## What IS that?
It's an example of the cool things one might do when he abuses DocPad enough.

## Pardon?
Take a look at the [test page](https://github.com/realyze/website_docpad_test/blob/master/src/documents/pages/test.html.jade). This is what you need to write as the content author. You can use Markdown. The image there is just to show you're not *limited* to Markdown.

Now look at the [test layout](https://github.com/realyze/website_docpad_test/blob/master/src/layouts/intro_layout.jade). This is what the HTML guys will write to give the page some structure.

The DocPad rendering machinery will take care of the, uh, rendering and will produce HTML partials we can use in the Angular app.

Neat, uh?
